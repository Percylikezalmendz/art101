			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local structure on your computer, add index.html files, and uppload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? 
						We struggled to figure out how to implement the code and make it appear on our website. I ended up going on inspect element on my old website and disected the code in order to figure out how to replicate it and adjust the size as I needed.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went really well once I started to go back and forth and figure out how to implement each element efficiently. I think I'm still implementing stuff in a sort of caveman, monkey-brain manner but it's getting the job done so I don't mind. We definitely put a ton of effort into this though.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We were able to figure out how to implement elements into our websites such as photos, photo sizes, and changing the background colors.</p>

					<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
					<p> Hello world! My name is Pricilla but I also go by Percy. I am a first year history major with an interest in Chicano and Latin American studies.
						I am from Delano, California, a small agricultural town in the Central Valley located near Bakersfield. I love creating art of all kinds, but my 
						favorite is through film photography and painting with acrylic paint. I love meeting new people and learning about new things, so if you see me
						around feel free to say hello!
